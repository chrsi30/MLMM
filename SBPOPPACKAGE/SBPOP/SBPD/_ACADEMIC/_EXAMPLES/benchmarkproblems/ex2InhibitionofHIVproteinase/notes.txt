>>> Ex2 - Parameter Identification Benchmark Project <<<

This benchmark example has been taken from the following publication:
Rodriguez-Fernandez, M., J. A. Egea and J. R. Banga (2006) Novel 
Metaheuristic for Parameter Estimation in Nonlinear Dynamic Biological 
Systems. BMC Bioinformatics 7:483. 

The contained model represents a system in which HIV proteinase (assay 
concentration 4nM) is added to a solution of an irreversible inhibitor and 
a fluorogenic substrate (25 uM).
