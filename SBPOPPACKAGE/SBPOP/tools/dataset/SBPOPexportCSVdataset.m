function [] = SBPOPexportCSVdataset(data,filename,varargin)
% [DESCRIPTION]
% This function exporst a MATLAB dataset as standard CSV datafile. 
% Nothing magic, just avoiding a lengthy "export" command.
%
% [SYNTAX]
% [] = SBPOPexportCSVdataset(data,filename)
% [] = SBPOPexportCSVdataset(data,filename,options)
%
% [INPUT]
% data:         a MATLAB dataset
% filename:     Filename, possibly including relative or absolute path.
%               Extension is arbitrary.
% options:      MATLAB structure with additional options
%
%               options.headerCharNONMEM: A character should be given,
%                   which is added as starting character into the first line.
%                   This is needed for NONMEM to be able to exclude the
%                   header from being read. ($DATA filename.csv
%                   IGNORE="CHAR"). Default: '' 
%
%               options.maxlengthNumbers: allows to define the maximum
%                   length of numbers in the datafile (NONMEM6 has a max of
%                   12). Default: Do not change anything ([]).
