function SBPOPrunNONMEMproject(projectPath,NONMEMprogram,NPROCESSORS)
% SBPOPrunNONMEMproject: runs a specified NONMEM project
%
% Essentially this function is just a simple wrapper.
%
% USAGE:
% ======
% SBPOPrunNONMEMproject(projectPath)
% SBPOPrunNONMEMproject(projectPath,NONMEMprogram)
% SBPOPrunNONMEMproject(projectPath,NONMEMprogram,NPROCESSORS)
%
% projectPath:   path to the .nmctl NONMEM project file
% NONMEMprogram: Name of command line NONMEM (default: 'nmfe72')
% NPROCESSORS:   Number of processors if use of parallel (default: 1)
%
% When NPROCESSORS>1 NONMEMprogram+'par' will be used as program name.
%
% Control NONMEM run from commandline:
% ====================================
% CTRL-J: Console iteration printing on/off 
% CTRL-K: Exit analysis at any time, which completes its output, and goes
%         on to next mode or estimation method
% CTRL-E: Exit program gracefully at any time
% CTRL-T: Monitor the progress of each individual during an estimation by
%         toggling ctrl-T. Wait 15 seconds or more to observe a subjectâ€™s
%         ID, and individual objective function value. It is also good to
%         test that the problem did not hang if a console output had not
%         been observed for a long while
