function [] = setseedSBPOP(defaultSeed)
% [DESCRIPTION]
% Set the default stream to defaultSeed. 
% In versions of MATLAB prior to 7.7, the control of the internal state of
% the random number stream used by rand is done by calling rand and randn
% directly with the 'seed'.
% For posterior version, the default stream is set by using RandStream
%
% [SYNTAX]
% [] = setseedSBPOP(defaultSeed)
%
% [INPUT]
% defaultSeed:   integer between 0 and 2^32.
