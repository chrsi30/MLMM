********** MODEL NAME
simple AR example

********** MODEL NOTES
A simple example model using an algebraic rule

********** MODEL STATES
% Differential equations are defined first
d/dt(A) = -R2 + R1
d/dt(B) = -R3 + R2 

% After the ODEs you can define the algebraic rules (ARs) in the following syntax:
% 0 = "mathematical expression" : "defined algebraic state" {"additional information for the state"} % comment
0 = C+B-5 : C % Algebraic rule, defining C (here a moiety conservation)
              % OF COURSE: it would be better to define a variable below as:   C = 5-B
              % but here I just want to demonstrate how to define ARs
              
% Finally you define the initial conditions. The initial conditions for the 
% algebraic states do not have to be consistent since the solver is able to find a 
% solution. But it is better and just makes more sense to at least try to find correct
% initial conditions.
A(0) = 1
B(0) = 0  
C(0) = 5
